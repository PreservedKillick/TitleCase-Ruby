Title Case with Ruby
==============

March 3, 2014

Epicodus: Week3, Day1 (part 2)

First day of Ruby and RSpec.

**********
Lesson:
To keep easing into things, let's revisit the Title Case problem from the other week. 

>Make a web page where a user can input a name and it converts it to title case (the first letter of each word capitalized). There are a lot of rules to title casing - think about words like the and and.

>Remember to start off simple. I like to pick the simplest possible behavior and write a spec for it, make it pass, and then pick the next simplest behavior. Here, I might start with a one-word title, and then return it back with the first letter capitalized. Next, I might write a spec for a one-word title that's all lower-case, and return back in title case. And so on.

As a reminder, make sure your code can handle inputs in all lowercase, all uppercase, a mix of different cases, one word, multiple words, and anything else you can think of.
